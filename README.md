Customize your Mark 1

## About
The Mycroft Mark 1 has several unique capabilities which this Skill lets you control.

### Eye Color
The Mark 1 has beautiful eyes -- and you get to pick their color!  Set them to
a named color ("blue", "magenta", "teal", etc) or any color using RGB values.
Pleas see the [color](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-mark-1/blob/dev/dialog/en-us/colors.value)
list for more options

###  Faceplate Brightness
Set the faceplate to a specific brightness, or allow it to automatically adjust
its brightness level to dim at night.

## Examples
* "Set your eye color to pink"
* "Change your eye color to the default"
* "Set a custom eye color" (you'll be prompted for values)
* "Turn on auto brightness"
* "Change to low brightness"
* "Dim to 50%"
